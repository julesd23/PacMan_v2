# PacMan_v2

## Description
This is a fun JavaScript demonstration of generating physics animations and cycling through an array of images. While working through this activity I gained a deeper understanding of loops and logic statements.
Description of Project (minimum of 20 words)

## How to Run
To run this on your machine simply go to the link of the project, press 'add pacman' for as many as you would like to have on the screen at one time, then select 'start game' to see all of the pacmen animate across the screen.

## Roadmap
I would like to add more funtionality in in the future such as deleting pacmen, as well as random physics characteristics like speed and size. Even further down the road I could see button controls being implemented.
